# nodes
##### using pointers (nodes) in java

###### GRAPH.java contains the java implementation most popular graph algorithms such as Dijkatra shortest path between nodes, BFS, DFS, Kruskal, Prims for MST and Bellman-Ford algorithm for single source shortest path. And also some custom functions for example checking if there is a oath between two nodes etc. 
 
#### Kruskal MST [->](https://github.com/Spectre-ak/nodes/blob/master/KruskalsMST.java) using Sets, HashMaps, PriorityQueues

#### Red Black Tree [->](https://github.com/Spectre-ak/nodes/blob/master/RedBlackTree.java)

#### Generic Red Black Tree [->](https://github.com/Spectre-ak/nodes/blob/master/RedBlackTreeX.java)
